\section{Literature Context and Critique}
\subsection{Key references}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Drude intraband emission under steady pumping (Sivan \& Dubi)---provides the energy-space benchmark reproduced here.
  \item ``Theory of Hot Photoluminescence from Drude Metals''---useful analytic series but uses a non-thermal distribution that overpopulates states; corrected below.
  \item Gold band-structure parameters near X/L (nonlinear SPP dynamics in Au nanowires; Rosei)---supply effective masses and offsets for anisotropic valleys.
  \item Photocatalysis literature for relaxation-time non-equilibrium distributions---basis for the corrected $f(\E;\omega_{\mathrm{L}})$ used here.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Findings from the review}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Distribution correctness.} Prior Drude-only derivations insert a non-thermal correction that violates Pauli exclusion. Using the Boltzmann+relaxation-time form in Eq.~\eqref{eq:nonthermal_dist} fixes this.
  \item \textbf{Density-of-states handling.} Several sources collapse $\rho_{J}$ into a single factor; keeping both initial and final eDOS terms is essential whenever $\hbarw$ approaches or exceeds $\EF$.
  \item \textbf{Momentum conservation.} Experimental agreement of intraband spectra with models that ignore momentum conservation implies an implicit phonon channel; for interband, direct transitions are available and should be treated explicitly.
\end{itemize}
