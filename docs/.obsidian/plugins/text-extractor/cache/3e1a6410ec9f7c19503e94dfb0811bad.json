Winsemius~ Kamerlingh Onnes Laboratorium, University of Leiden, The ¹therlands (Received 26 November 1974) Very accurate ellipsometric measurements were made on very pure bulk samples of Au at room temperature in the 1.0-3.5-eV energy region. A model calculation has been developed for d bands to Fermi-surface transitions occurring near the X point in the Brillouin zone and it is shown that for topological reasons the line shape of the imaginary part of the dielectric constant e2 is considerably different from what has been calculated for L transitions. Using this model to fit our experimental data it has been possible to show that the absorption edge in Au is \"split\" into two separate contributions. The onset of X transitions has been located at 1.94 eV while the onset of the L transitions has been confirmed at 2.45 eV in excellent agreement with previous determinations. I. INTRODUCTION The characteristic shape of the interband transi- tion edge of gold has been the subject of consider- able interest and speculation in recent years. While it is widely recognized that the steep rise of e~ at about 2. 5 eV is originating from d bands to Fermi-surface transitions near L, much more puzzling is the origin of a long nearly exponential tail which extends well below 2 eV. Indeed, in their pioneering paper' Cooper, Ehrenreich, and Philipp showed, using a model calculation, that the expected line shape for the joint density of states at zero temperature should behave like a square-root singularity (roughly like an Mo critical point). Several authors ' have been able to fit their ex- perimental data with the expected line shape in a limited energy region. Even taking into account the expected temperature broadening of the edge due to the Fermi-distribution smearing out, it is not pos- sible to explain the magnitude and extention of the low-energy tail. Various mechanisms were pro- posed: Nilsson et al. speculated that deformation of electronic bands due to lattice defects was to be held responsible, or alternatively the lifetime broadening of the absorption edge; Theye also found an irreducible tail in her very careful mea- surements on thin films and invoked an Auger-type broadening of the edge. Lately, the belief that the tailing of the absorp- tion edge is largely due to genuine interband transi- tions has been prevailing. As a matter of fact, Christensen and Seraphin showed that the change of slope at 2. 2 eV follows directly from the band calculation, the first transition occurring from band 5 to band 6 (at Ez) near X Szczepanek and Qlosser' find structure starting at about I. 8 eV in the tetragonal spectra of their piezomodulation experiment and assign it to inter- band transitions near X. Despite the growing evidence, a few interroga- tives remain on the role of the X transitions. Even if it is acknowledged that they may have much weaker dipole matrix element, it is not clear why they present a smooth increase instead of a steep edge as L transitions do. Also puzzling is their failure to appear in thermomodulation experi- ments, since it is recognized that transitions ending at the Fermi surface give an important con- tribution in these spectra. In Sec. II we present new very accurate experi- mental data of the imaginary part of the dielectric function e~ of gold in the interband onset region. In Sec. III we give the derivation of the line shape for the X transitions extending a technique already successfully used to fit thermomodulation data and the absorption edge of Ag. It is shown that indeed, owing to the topology of the constant-en- ergy surfaces (CES) and of the constant-energy- difference surfaces (CEDS) in k space, the theory predicts a smoothly sloping edge in contrast with the steep edge characteristic of L transitions. Section IV shows how the experimental data can be fitted in the onset region summing the contribu- tions for both X and L transitions. Finally, in Sec. V the reasons for the failure of the X transitions to appear in thermomodulation data are elucidated and suggestions are given for designing an experi- ment which would bring out their contribution. II. EXPERIMENTAL A. Experimental setup Using the method of Beattie, the optical proper- ties of Au were measured between 1.0 and 3. 5 eV at room temperature (angle of incidence = 69 ).

Figure 4 reports the shape of the JDQS obtained for zero, room temper- ature and 600 K. It is very important to note that even at 0 K the X transitions do not present a sharp edge but only a gently sloping absorption. Their behavior is therefore quite different from that presented by L transitions. This difference can be traced in the different topology of CES and CEDS at X and I., respectively, as will be explained in the following. In order to understand physically this behavior it is convenient to follow the \"path\" of the function 560 M. GVERRISI, R. ROSEI, AND P.

Figure 5 shows the CEDS corresponding to six different interband photon energies together with the Fermi surface, while Fig. 6 gives the EDJDOS calculated at the same energies. In other words each curve in Fig. 6 shows how the density of inter- band transitions is distributed on the corresponding CEDS of Fig. 5. The boxlike functions in Fig. 6 FIG. 6. Absorption mechanism for band-5-band-6 transitions near X. The EDJDOS (E) is reported for several photon energies. The boxlike function gives in each case the probability that the final state is empty at zero temperature. The integrand in Kq. (7) is given by the product of the two curves. The absorption is given in each case by the hatched areas. represent the probability P(E) = 1 f(E, 0) that—the final state is empty at zero temperature. It is important to note that the singularity ex- hibited by the EDJDOS is in this case steplike, while the corresponding EDJDOS for L transitions presents an inverse square-root singularity. The different behavior can be easily understood when it is realized that for L transitions the CEDS cor- responding to the onset is tangent to the Fermi sur- face along a circle (the neck of the Fermi surface) thus giving rise to an infinite density of possible transitions with final energy in an interval E», E+~+dE. At X, the tangency is limited to a point and the discontinuity of the EDJDOS should there- fore be finite. Following now the \"path\" of the EDJDOS on in- creasing the photon energies, it is easily under- stood that above the edge, obtained for Se = Aux = 1. 94 eV, the absorption (which is proportional to the shaded areas) increases approximately linearly with photon energies.

III we obtained the JDOS for transitions near X. The procedure for obtaining the JDOS for transitions at L has been presented in a number of papers ' and will not be repeated here. In the constant matrix element approximation the JDOS can be easily related to the imaginary part of the dielectric function. In the following it will be assumed that the dipole element for X transi- 12 \"SPLITTING\" OF THE INTE RBAND. . . 561 0 ~/4a &/4a, k.

Assuming that in the region around and just above the onset no other interband transition contributes, we can write 8~~~~g 4 3m'(8'(o)' ~[IP (~-u)I &x(@» T)+ IP.(f-u)l' X gz(h~, T)] . (8) The other parameters requested by the theory, e. g. , the optical masses and the gaps h&~ andX6 h ~L were taken from Ref. 4.L4- It should be noted that this fitting allows for the first time a direct determination of the k depen- dence of the optical dipole matrix element and shows that the usual approximation of setting it con- stant throughout the whole BZ involves large er- rors. We have used our model for fitting also other experimental data taken from Ref. 3. It is partic- ularly interesting to compare the results since Th5ye's data were taken on thin films w'hile our data were taken on bulk samples. We obtained an excellent fit using the parameters @~L.=1.565 ev, @~x,=1.650 eV,L4+ v' I Px/Pl I =0. 321, and an effective temperature T of 700 K. It is striking that while the L gap does not change Using this analytic expression for e2 we tried to fit our experimental data to about 2. 7 eV. Only limited regions in K space around X and around L are involved in our model when the fitting is ex- tended a few tenths of an eV above the absorption edge. It should be remembered however that al- though occurring in different regions of the Bril- louin zone (BZ): we are dealing in both cases with band-5-band-6 transitions. The danger of count- ing transitions twice and of a breakdown of our ap- proximations may therefore arise at higher photon energies. The energy gaps shown in Figs. 2 and 7 were used as fitting parameters as well as the \"strength\" of the two transitions defined, respectively, as s» = vx IP (f- u) I s, = ri I Px(&- u) I (lo) The experimental data were first corrected by sub- tracting the background absorption (which has been supposed to be Drude-like). The fit is shown in Fig. 8. The result we ob- tained is fairly good also using the nominal tem- 2.0 2.2 %f0(e&1 FIG. 8.
