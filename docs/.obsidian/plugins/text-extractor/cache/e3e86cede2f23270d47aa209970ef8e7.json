Here, we re-derive the main analytical results of that study from very simple arguments, and draw a series of conclusions which contradict claims made in previous studies of the steady-state distribution. In particular, we show that the faster chemical reactions reported in many previous papers are extremely unlikely to originate from high energy non-thermal electrons. Instead, the faster reactions very likely originate from a purely thermal eﬀect. I. Introduction In recent years, a central focus of research into nanoplasmonics has been on nding ways to exploit the enhanced absorption exhibited by nanoplasmonic systems. Two main routes are discussed in the literature. First, it was shown that plasmonic nanostructures can be eﬃcient sources of heat on the nanoscale,1,2 a research topic that is usually referred to as thermo-plasmonics. This has enabled a wide range of emerging applications at diﬀerent temperature ranges, such as photothermal imaging,3,4 cancer treatment, 5 plasmonic photovoltaics,6 water boiling, sanitation and super-heating,7–9 solvothermal (hydro-thermal) chemistry,10 thermo-photovoltaics,11,12 diﬀusive switching,13 thermoelectrics,14 plasmon-assisted chemical vapor deposition 15 and heat-assisted magnetic recording, 16 which may involve temperatures even higher than 2000 K. Clearly, the generation of heat is a result of internal thermalization processes that convert the high energy non-thermal electron distribution generated initially by the absorption of photons to a thermal distribution. In that context, a second way to exploit heat has emerged – it was hypothesized that the initially generated aUnit of Electro-Optics Engineering, Ben-Gurion University, Israel.

This is important to know because although heating is frequently used in catalysis, it is accompanied by various undesired side eﬀects (such as the enhancement of additional parasitic reac- tions)18 and incurs signicant practical and nancial complications for real-life applications. As a result, heating is generally avoided in practice. Very few attempts have been made to distinguish experimentally between thermal and non-thermal eﬀects. This should be done by reproducing the same temperature rise caused by laser illumination through the use of purely external heating. Clearly, it is very diﬃcult to measure temperature on the nanoscale with suﬃcient spatial resolution; indeed, thermometry methods for metal nano- structures have emerged only in the last few years (e.g. ref. 34–36). An alternative determination of the temperature via numerical simulation is simple for a single nanoparticle (NP),37,38 but non-trivial in the presence of many nanoparticles due to the long range inter-particle thermal interactions39,40 which give rise to (highly) non-uniform temperatures on multiple length-scales. For example, in ref. 41 the control experiment showed that the chemistry is sensitive to the external temperature, i.e. the metal does more than just enhance photon absorption.42 However, the control experiment was carried out at a temperature measured far away from the illuminated nanoparticles, and this was most likely lower than the actual nanoparticle temperature, as noted later on by the same group of authors43 and by others.44 Even if the temperature is known, it is not easy to perform meaningful control experiments due to the diﬃculty in reproducing the non- uniform temperature distribution across the typical suspension volume with an external heat source. In pulsed experiments, this is even more diﬃcult due to the transient nature of the temperatures and the diﬀerences between the electron and lattice temperatures. In addition to all these practical complications, there has been also a funda- mental controversy regarding the denition of temperature for metal nano- structures under illumination. Indeed, one could naively argue that upon illumination, the system is out of equilibrium, meaning that temperature – inherently an equilibrium property – cannot be well dened. 45 Accordingly, while temperatures were dened aer the initial non-equilibrium stage that follows ultrafast illumination (see for example ref. 46 and 47), all previous theoretical studies of continuous wave (CW) illumination treated the non-equilibrium in great detail, but ignored the possibility of an increase in the electron and phonon temperatures to above the environment temperature. In order to reconcile this paradox, in ref. 48 we suggested a unique solution for the determination of the steady-state temperature developing in a metal nano- structure, based only on energy conservation and basic thermodynamics. Specically, we developed a self-contained theory for the photo-generation of non- thermal energetic carriers in metal nanostructures based on a quantum-like Faraday Discussions Paper Faraday Discuss.

The steady-state solution of this set of equations ensures energy conservation – the power owing into the metal due to photon absorption is exactly balanced by heat leakage to the environment. Since there is obviously only one pair of values for the electron and phonon temperatures for which this happens, the approach of ref. 48 enables a determination of the temperature(s) of a system which is out of equilibrium in a unique and unambiguous way. This approach also enables a comparison, for the rst time to our knowledge, of the relative importance of thermal and non-thermal eﬀects. The simulations showed that the population of non-thermal energetic elec- trons and holes88 can increase dramatically under illumination, yet this process is extremely ineﬃcient, as the majority of the absorbed energy leads to heating; the electron and phonon temperatures are found to be similar, thus justifying the use of the (classical) single temperate heat model.2 Somewhat surprisingly, we found that just above (below) the Fermi energy, the non-equilibrium consists of holes (electrons), rather than the other way around; we showed that this behaviour is due to the dominance of e–ph collisions. The results of ref. 48 were based on a rather complicated and slowly converging numerical procedure involving standard but cumbersome scattering integrals. This approach also lacks deep physical insights. In the current manuscript, we provide several simple estimates of the numerical results obtained in ref. 48 that partially obviate the need for the heavy/lengthy numerical procedure performed so far. We also apply the results of ref. 48 to show that, unlike what is frequently claimed in the literature, the density of high energy non-thermal carriers is, to leading order at least, independent of the NP size and shape, and that in fact, small spherical NPs are the least eﬃcient source of high energy non-thermal carriers. Furthermore, we develop a simple model for photocatalysis which shows that it is highly unlikely that the faster chemical reactions observed experimentally are due to the generation of non-thermal, high energy carriers in the metal. The faster reactions much more likely originate from a purely thermal eﬀect. Finally, we describe several experi- ments that have to be carried out to conrm our predictions. II. A simple calculation of the electron distribution and temperatures In this section, we briey reintroduce the theoretical model reported in ref. 48 and show how to obtain some of its numerical results without going though a full- scale numerical calculation, based on standard, physically-sensible assumptions.

The second term on the RHS of eqn (1) describes the energy relaxation due to collisions between electrons and phonons (see ref. 48 and 54 for its explicit form). The third term on the RHS of eqn (1) represents the thermali- zation induced by e–e collisions, i.e. the convergence of the non-thermal pop- ulation into the thermalized Fermi–Dirac distribution, given by f TðE; TeÞ¼ \u00051 þ e ðE\u0002EFÞ=kBTe \u0006\u00021: (2) Here, kB is the Boltzmann constant and E F is the Fermi energy.89 The explicit form of the e–e relaxation term used in our formulation can be found in ref. 48.

This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019 èie“ÅŨ…¿ic˝eÅå˙˝i˙e In order to avoid the heavy numerical computation of the BE and the rate equations above, we adopt several standard approximations. First, we approxi- mate We–e and W NT e–ph as GeU NT e and GphU NT e , where Ge and Gph are the eﬀective time scales that represent the decay of the non-thermal energy due to e–e and e–ph collisions, respectively. Such an estimate is customary within the approach known as the (extended) Two Temperature Model ((e)TTM), initially introduced phenomenologically58 and later derived from a classical point of view in ref. 59. As an initial guess, we can set G\u00021 e \u0004 0.5 ps and G\u00021 ph \u0004 1 ps. 53,58–60 We also replace W T e–ph with Ge–ph(Te \u0002 Tph), an approximation which has been shown to be an excellent approximation for Te < 3000 K.46,54,61–63 Following this, the above rate equations become dU NT e dt ¼\u0002GeU NT e \u0002 GphU NT e þ W NT ex ; dU eT dt ¼ GeU NT e \u0002 Ge\u0002ph\u0005Te \u0002 Tph\u0006 þ WexT ; dU ph dt ¼ Ge\u0002ph\u0005Te \u0002 Tph\u0006 \u0002 Gph\u0002env\u0005Tph \u0002 Tenv\u0006 þ GphU NT e ; where we also set Wph-env ¼ Gph-env(Tph \u0002 Tenv). This set of equations in fact provides a self-consistent derivation of the (e)TTM from the BE; similar deriva- tions were previously suggested in ref. 64–66, 90 and 91. For CW illumination, the system is in a steady-state. Thus, U NT e ¼ W NT ex =ðGe þ GphÞ, Ge Ge þ GphW NT ex þ W T ex ¼ Ge\u0002ph\u0005Te \u0002 Tph\u0006 and Ge\u0002ph\u0005Te \u0002 Tph\u0006 ¼ Gph\u0002env\u0005Tph \u0002 Tenv\u0006 \u0002 Gph Ge þ GphW NT ex : Therefore, via simple algebra, we can derive the following equations: Te ¼ Tph þ Ge Ge þ GphW NT ex þ W T ex Ge\u0002ph ; (3) Tph ¼ Tenv þ W NT ex þ W T ex Gph\u0002env : (4) Eqn (3) and (4) show that Te and Tph grow linearly with the incident intensity (via the absorbed power density, eqn (A1)–(A6)). The diﬀerence between the temperatures is also proportional to the absorbed power density. Most importantly, the diﬀerence between the two temperatures is independent of the particle size and coupling to the environment; it instead depends only on Paper Faraday Discussions This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019 Faraday Discuss. èie“ÅŨ…¿ic˝eÅå˙˝i˙e the internal details of the electron subsystem and on the e–ph coupling coeﬃcient, Ge–ph. B. High energy non-thermal carrier density In order to determine the density of high energy non-thermal carriers, we exploit the fact that e–ph interactions are important only near the Fermi energy (see specically ref. 48, Fig. S2(b)). The reason for that, by the FLT, is that the energy lost by a high energy non-thermal electron in a collision is a signicant part of its excess energy with respect to the Fermi energy. Since that energy is much higher than the phonon energies, they are not generated during collisions of high energy non-thermal electrons. Thus, the electron population far away from the Fermi energy can be determined simply by balancing the electron excitation rate with the e–e collision rate. Indeed, we show in Appendix: A that the density of high energy non-thermal carriers is given by Df NTðEÞ\u0004 se\u0002eðEÞRjEj2; (5) where Rh 4303 00 mðupÞ ħ EF 3Emaxne (denitions of the various parameters can be found in Appendix: A) and E is the local electric eld. This is found to be in excellent agreement with the numerical results (see Fig. 1). Eqn (5) not only provides a simple way to compute the high energy, non- thermal carrier population, but also provides fundamental insight into the physics of non-thermal carrier generation. Specically, it shows that the non- thermal carrier population is independent of the ambient temperature, phonon temperature and the temperature of the electrons, as well as of the thermal properties of the system. This means that previous studies of the steady-state electron distribution (e.g. ref. 67–70) could have been used to calculate quanti- tatively the high energy non-thermal carrier density correctly.92 However, they could not have been used to obtain the distribution near the Fermi energy because of the neglect of the temperature rise; accordingly, the relative amount of power going to the thermal and non-thermal channels has not been evaluated thus far. This also means that previous approaches incorrectly account for the role of interband transitions which, due to the need to bridge the bandgap energy, cause an increase in the non-thermal carrier distribution relatively close to the Fig. 1 The population f ðEÞ of holes at E ¼ 1:8 eV (<ħup) below the Fermi level (blue rectangles) and electrons at E ¼ 1:8 eV above the Fermi level (orange triangles), compared with the estimate (5) (black dashed line).

This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019 èie“ÅŨ…¿ic˝eÅå˙˝i˙e Fermi energy.68 In fact, assuming that the number of excess electrons generated near the Fermi energy is comparable to that in the high energy shoulders, it is most likely that their contribution would be negligible with respect to the thermal changes. Accordingly, one should re-examine all claims about the relative importance of interband transitions for the generation of non-thermal carriers.71 A further implication of the accuracy of theestimate(5) is the independence of the density of high energy non-thermal carriers on the shape and size of the metal nanoparticle. Indeed, since it has been shown via fully quantum mechanical calculations that the e–e collision rates are independent of the particle size (e.g. ref. 47 and 72), it follows from eqn (5) that the density depends on theNPsizeand shapeonly via the value of the local eld. This claim is corroborated by the numerical results of Section III below & Fig. 2. This result is in contradiction to the claims that have frequently appeared in previous studies. It should be noted that the metal interface may support long-lived surface states which, in turn, might allow for a higher density of high energy non-thermal carriers.However,the importance of such states should be weighted by their relative number, which is surely small, especially for spherical nanoparticles of more than a few nm in size. Finally, we note that the estimate (5) is essentially identical to the result for the population of the excited state in a system with discrete energy states (e.g. a two level system) in the weak excitation limit. This means that (se–eR)\u00021/2 is essentially the eﬀective saturation eld for the metal, jEsatj ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ZIsat=ð2nÞ p .93 Then, assuming that the absorptivity of a single metal atom is comparable to that of a single gas atom or a semiconductor atom, it follows that since the relaxation rate of the metal electron is about 6 orders of magnitude faster compared with the relax- ation of a gas or semiconductor atom, then the square of the saturation eld, |Esat|2, of the metal will be 6 orders of magnitude higher than in an atomic gas or a semi- conductor. For Isat \u0004 10 7 Wcm \u00022 (typical for a gas or semiconductor atom), it is easy to see that |Esat|2 \u0004 100 U$10 7 Wcm \u00022 ¼ 10 13 V 2 m \u00022.InAppendix: A, we obtained |Esat|2 \u0004 2.5 \u0005 10 19 V 2 m \u00022, which is in excellent agreement with the above estimate. This shows that accounting for the discreteness of the energy states (as for the atomic physics case) or neglecting it (as in our approach) has, at most, a minor eﬀect on the resulting density of high energy electrons. This conclusion is the opposite of the conclusions drawn in previous studies.

Dependence on nanoparticle size and shape Previous studies have claimed that particles with sharp edges, for which regions of strong electric elds (also confusingly referred to as “hot spots” 94) of electric elds occur, are superior for the purpose of generating high energy, non-thermal carriers. Unfortunately, however, these claims were based on what we believe to be a somewhat improper comparison. Specically, while previous comparisons were carried out for particles of the same volume (and probably the same incident intensity), the changes in size and shape incur changes in the resonance position and quality, therefore resulting in a change in the local electric eld within the NP. Thus, the diﬀerences observed in such comparisons ensue partially (if not completely) from these purely classical electromagnetic eﬀects, meaning that it is not clear what conclusion can be made from such a comparison. In that sense, a better suited comparison should be made for particles with the same volume and the same average internal (squared) elds, ð V jEj2dV . Such a comparison would also allow one to isolate the role of additional quantum mechanical eﬀects from the purely classical electrodynamic considerations associated with the quality and position of the optical response. Since we observed in ref. 48 that away from the Fermi energy the density of high energy carriers is proportional to the square of the local eld, f \u0004 |E|2, it is immediately obvious that, to leading order, the total number of carriers at a given energy (away from the Fermi energy) is the same for NPs with the same (average) internal eld, regardless of their shape and of the electric eld distribution. Some diﬀerences may still exist due to eld and temperature gradients. These, however, are expected to be weak – the charge currents created by the electric eld non-uniformity are assumed to be weak (due to the fast e–e collisions and the high conductance of the metal); heat currents are denitely weak – indeed, the temperature uniformity is excellent due to the high thermal conductivity within the metal. Either way, the neglect of these currents is, to the best of our knowl- edge, common to all previous studies, and will accordingly be adopted here as well. Having said that, we should emphasize that the electron distribution near the Fermi energy (hence, the electron temperature) might be very sensitive to theshape andsizeof the NP.Indeed, theparticlesizeand shapeaﬀect the coupling eﬃciency of heat to the environment, manifested via the phonon- environment coupling coeﬃcient Gph-env (introduced in Section A). In ref. 37, Baﬀou et al. used exact numerical simulations to provide accurate empirical expressions for the eﬀective thermal coupling coeﬃcient to the environment for various generic particle shapes. In particular, they showed that since a spherical nanoparticle has a minimal surface area-to-volume ratio, it is optimal in terms of holding on to the heat generated within it. Accordingly, one can expect that for a given average (squared) local eld (which is directly proportional to the absorbed power, see eqn (A4)), a sphere will be the hottest among all other particles. Thus, overall, while the number of non-thermal carriers generated within a sphere is the same as in any other particle (for a given average local eld and particle volume), it exhibits the poorest relative eﬃciency of thermal vs. non-thermal energy partition.

This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019 èie“ÅŨ…¿ic˝eÅå˙˝i˙e These expectations are conrmed by numerical solutions of the Boltzmann eqn (1) for Ag rods with various aspect ratios but with the same volume. As the input electromagnetic eld, we used a xed value representing the averaged square of the local electric eld rather than the eld itself (see our justication above). One can see that the lowest temperature is attained for a rod with a 1 : 5 aspect ratio due to its 30% stronger coupling coeﬃcient of heat to the environ- ment (Fig. 2). The population of the high energy, non-thermal carriers is, however, the same for the diﬀerent rods. Our approach also shows the diﬀerences in the non-thermal distributions near the Fermi-energy for two diﬀerent wavelengths. Specically, the change in wavelength aﬀects the shoulder width (due to the change in ħup) and height (due to the change in the density of states at E and pabs with the illumi- nation wavelength95). For example, fA,1.75 eV/fA,2.25 eV z 1.3 and NAð1:75 eVÞ=NAð2:25 eVÞ¼ 3 00 mð1:75 eVÞ=300 mð2:25 eVÞ¼ 1:35 (ref. 73) for the same average eld. As a result, |Df NT 1.75 eV|/|Df NT 2.25 eV| ¼ (NA(1.75 eV)fA,1.75 eV)/(NA(2.25 eV) fA,2.25 eV) z 1.76, which is in excellent agreement with the numerical results. IV. Non-thermal carriers and photocatalysis We now wish to make the connection between our theory, in which the (non- thermal) carrier distribution is evaluated, and photocatalysis, namely the enhancement of a reaction rate due to the presence of an illuminated nano- particle (NP). The rst stage is to understand the nature of the photocatalytic process, and its relation to the electron distribution in the NP. To this end, we follow the reasoning (based on the specic example of hydrogen molecule dissociation) presented in ref. 41, as depicted in Fig. 3. Consider a reaction pathway dened by a free energy curve in some reaction coordinate (blue solid line) leading from the initial state to the product state (in H2 dissociation the initial and product states are H2sg and the dissociated molecule 2H, respectively, Fig. 3 Schematic illustration of the photocatalytic process. The molecule absorbs an electron from the NP, thus going from the initial state to the excited state. The barrier that has to be crossed to reach the product state is much smaller now, resulting in a much higher reaction rate. During the relaxation process the excess electron returns to the NP. Paper Faraday Discussions This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019 Faraday Discuss. èie“ÅŨ…¿ic˝eÅå˙˝i˙e and the reaction coordinate is the H–H bond length). This reaction is limited by the energy barrier E0 (\u00042.3 eV for H2 dissociation), which is practically unreachable at room temperature. Now, the molecular system is placed in the vicinity of a NP, from which elec- trons with energy Ein can hop onto the molecule (dashed gray arrow), thus generating a charged excited state (the state Hd\u0002 2 s * u in the H2 dissociation example). In this sense, the NP is nothing but an electron reservoir available to the molecular system. The excited state molecule has a diﬀerent reaction path (solid orange line), with a smaller energy barrier for the reaction. This reduction of the energy barrier is the essence of the catalytic process. At some point along the reaction path, the excess electron returns to the NP with energy Eout (dotted gray arrow), and the system returns to the neutral-state reaction path. The concept of “hot electron-assisted photocatalysis” is based on the concept that illumination of the NP will dramatically increase the probability of electrons (in the NP) having energy E in, thus making their excess energy available for the chemical reaction to occur. We can now try to relate this description to the evaluation of the electronic distribution function in the NP. For the electrons in the NP, the nearby molecule that undergoes the reaction can be considered as a source of irreversible energy loss, whereby electrons come in with energy E in and leave, aer some reaction time, sr, with energy E out. Therefore, within a Boltzmann equation description of the electron distribution, this term can be written as \u0001 df dt \u0003 react \u0004 gr f ðE inÞð1 \u0002 f ðE outÞÞ; (6) where gr ¼ s\u00021 r is the bare reaction rate, i.e. the rate at which the chemical system undergoes the reaction aer being excited by an additional electron (which is the rate-limiting step). More realistically, one can assume that there is some broad- ening to the energies E in;out, resulting in a term that looks like \u0001 df dt \u0003 react \u0004 gr ð dE ð dE 0gðE; E in; sÞgðE; E out; sÞf ðEÞ 1 \u0002 f \u0005E 0\u0006\u000b; (7) where gðE; E 0; sÞ is a Gaussian centered around E0 with width s. Eqn (6) is reproduced if the limit s / 0 is taken, i.e., taking g to be a d-function. In principle, eqn (7) should be inserted into the full Boltzmann equation for the distribution function (1). However, since chemical kinetics are substantially slower than electronic processes, gr is much smaller than any of the other terms (photo-excitation, electron–electron and electron–phonon scattering terms) in the Boltzmann equation. It follows that in order to determine the steady-state distribution, the gr-term can be neglected. In other words, the chemical reac- tion does not aﬀect the electron distribution in the NP. The photocatalytic reac- tion rate is therefore dened by eqn (6) or (7), and since 1 \u0002 f ðE outÞ\u0004 1, it can be approximated by gr f ðE inÞ. This is a rather intuitive result; the photocatalytic rate is proportional to the bare reaction rate multiplied by the probability of nding an electron at the relevant energy (factors such as the density of states go into the proportionality constant). The conclusion to be drawn from this simple set of arguments is straightforward and unavoidable; if this mechanism indeed describes the experiments, then the reaction rate should increase in pro- portionality to the increase in the high-energy part of the electron distribution.

This is nowhere near the increase in reaction rate observed for any experiment reporting metal NP-assisted photocatalysis; specically, it is far higher than what was observed in ref. 74, which found a mild 6-fold increase in the reaction rate. We therefore conclude that “hot carriers” are extremely unlikely to be responsible for the observed increase in the reaction rate. The strong dependence of the photocatalytic rate on the substrate implies that the reason for the faster chemistry is merely heating. Indeed, faster reactions were observed with a glass substrate, which has a much lower thermal conductivity (in comparison with the TiO2 substrate used in ref. 41), thus giving rise to higher temperatures in the nanoparticles. V. Summary & outlook The simplied analysis of Section II enables an eﬀortless determination of the electron distribution function, the electron temperature and the phonon temperature for metals under steady-state illumination. This should motivate a re-examination of all previous recent theoretical studies of the non- equilibrium in metallic nanostructures that did not account for thermal eﬀects. It should also be the basis for improved modelling, e.g. by accounting for more realistic band structures (thus enabling a comparison of diﬀerent metals), considering more complex nanostructures (involving diﬀerent mate- rials, especially semiconductors that provide an independent source of “hot” carriers42), adding (secondary) physical mechanisms (surface states, carrier tunneling, eld and temperature gradients etc.), and studying the competing contributions of thermal and non-thermal eﬀects to the nonlinear response of metals etc. Our results also enable a re-evaluation of the interpretations of previous experiments. In particular, since the model reported in Section IV predicts dramatically faster chemistry (many orders of magnitude faster reaction rates), the absence of such an eﬀect in the experimental data reported thus far implies that it is extremely unlikely that the faster chemistry reported was indeed due to the generation of high energy, non-thermal carriers. This conclusion should induce a more careful examination of the origin and energy scale of the faster reactions in those studies, which are far less sensitive to the presence of the metal and illumination than predicted in Section IV. Most likely, the mechanism responsible for the faster reactions will turn out to be mere regular heating. Conversely, our theory can provide insight into the design of experiments in which high energy, non-thermal carriers are dominant. In this vein, we hope that our results will motivate a quantitative comparison of the theoretical predictions with experimental data. The latter should include measurements of the metal temperature using one of the emerging techniques (e.g., ref. 34–36, 75–80) together with electron photo-emission spectroscopy measurements.81–83 Ideally, these measurements should be carried out for a single particle (such as in ref. 42, 81, 84 and 85) in order to exclude multi-particle heating interactions, which are relatively hard to quantify. 40,41 Paper Faraday Discussions This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019 Faraday Discuss. èie“ÅŨ…¿ic˝eÅå˙˝i˙e Appendix: A.

E, 2017, 96, 012212. 88 Negative values of f \u0002 f T are referred to as holes, regardless of their position with respect to the Fermi energy. This nomenclature is conventional within the literature51 89 Note that we ignore here the diﬀerence between the Fermi energy and the chemical potential; we veried via simulations that the diﬀerence between them is truly negligible in all of the cases we studied. 90 Note that the eTTM does not capture the increase in the rate of energy transfer to the lattice during the thermalization time, as discussed in ref. 53. However, this eﬀect should have, at most, a modest quantitative eﬀect on the issues discussed in the current work. 91 Note that the diﬀerences between eqn (A) and the more conventional TTM extend only to the initial non-thermal regime, for which the temperature is anyhow not well dened. 92 Yet, in these papers, the authors did not attempt to claim more than a qualitative prediction of the “hot electron” density. 93 Z being the material impedance of the gas/semiconductor and n its refractive index.

However, this eﬀect is not taken into account in the current calculation.
